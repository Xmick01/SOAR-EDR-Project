# SOAR-EDR-Project


## Objective

The SOAR EDR project focuses on creating a practical, automated security workflow using LimaCharlie, Tines, Slack, and email. The goal is to establish a streamlined process for detecting and responding to security threats. This involves setting up LimaCharlie to identify specific threats, such as a hack tool (Lazagne), and utilizing Tines to automate responses. Alerts with detailed information are sent to Slack and email, prompting a decision on whether to isolate a machine. If isolation is approved, it is automatically carried out.
The project integrates various security tools to enhance the efficiency of the detection and response process. By completion, participants will gain hands-on experience in setting up detection rules, creating automated playbooks, and managing security alertsâ€”key skills for any cybersecurity professional.

## Step 1: Diagram of Playbook

![SOAR EDR playbook diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec7a5f1d-02f0-48bf-9145-c91e6fe49a09)
 
1. Detection: Lima Charlie detects the presence of a hacker tool on an endpoint.
2. Notification: Lima Charlie sends a detection alert to Tines. Tines then *sends notifications with the relevant details to both Slack and the SOC analyst's email. These details include the time of detection, computer name, source IP, process, command line, file path, sensor ID, and a link to the detection.
3. User Prompt: The SOC analyst receives the notifications and clicks on a link to access the user prompt provided by Tines. This prompt presents the option to either isolate or not isolate the affected computer.
4. Action Based on SOC Analyst Decision:
* If the SOC analyst chooses not to isolate the computer:
  * A message is sent to Slack (specifically to the #alert channel) indicating that the computer was not isolated and advising to investigate further.
* If the SOC analyst chooses to isolate the computer:
  * Lima Charlie automatically isolates the computer.
  * A message is sent to Slack (specifically to the #alert channel) indicating that the computer has been successfully isolated.

This workflow ensures that appropriate actions are taken based on the SOC analyst's decision and that relevant parties are notified through Slack.

## Step 2: Install and Setup LimaCharlie 

* Use a cloud provider, like Vultr, or virtualization software like VirtualBox or VMware to create two virtual machines (VMs). One VM machine will be Kali Linux and the other machine will be a Windows machine.

![vultr microsoft machine](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d61cd845-e3ec-449f-bce4-b626b9fcdb8b)

* Add a firewall to the instance. Select MS RDP (Microsoft Remote Desk Protocol) at port 3389 and the source will be "My IP Address."
 ![SOAR EDR firewall](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/844ca1af-6310-4159-9cad-1b9181e0a182)
  * Restricting Access: By setting the source to "My IP Address," the firewall rule ensures that only the IP address specified can initiate an RDP session. This restricts access to a known, trusted IP address and blocks any unauthorized IP addresses from attempting to connect.
  * Enhanced Security: This configuration adds a layer of security by limiting potential attack vectors. Only connections from the specified IP address will be allowed, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and brute-force attacks.
* Sign up for LimaCharlie

* Paste the installation key
 
![powershell install](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e67a11c8-8810-4c30-9c59-8ecf34f992cb)

![powershell install successful](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14300337-b268-4469-a1f1-2f801ec335f9)

* After installing, check LimaCharlie to see if the server is listed.

![limacharlie sensor list info](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d13bbd7a-bd5d-4937-ba03-83b4b95ed5af)

## Step 3: Install Lazagne and Create Detection and Response Rule

* Go to the [github](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne) for Lazagne and download it. It is a hacker tool, so make sure to turn off Windows Defender to avoid blocking the download.

![lazagne ran](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3bd9cce-4698-488a-a8e6-1e3fb9231b42)

* After installing, check LimaCharlie to see if the server is listed.

![limacharlie sensor list info](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d13bbd7a-bd5d-4937-ba03-83b4b95ed5af)

* After installation and execution of Lazagne should be detected by LimaCharlie. Just search the timeline for Lazagne and it should be there.

![lazagne timeline](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7006169c-7974-4650-9ff6-a0aa94a23a03)

  * The expanded event tab gives additional information on the event. It shows the command line, file sign, file path, hash, parent, powershell, username, etc.
* Navigate to the Automation tab and create a new detection and response rule, here is the template for that from [github](https://github.com/MyDFIR/SOAR-EDR-Project?tab=readme-ov-file)
   * It is best to look for templates for rules like this rather than build a rule from scratch.
   * This detection and response rule monitors for the execution of LaZagne, a hacking tool, on Windows systems. It triggers when a new or existing process matches any of these conditions: the file path ends with "LaZagne.exe," the command line ends with "all" or contains "LaZagne," or the file hash matches a known LaZagne hash. When these conditions are met, the system initiates a response, such as alerting SOC analysts and isolating the affected machine.
* Verify that the rules are good by testing them before moving on.

![event rules test](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f7324c8-f1aa-44e1-a1a8-0866ccf37f5d)

* Run Lazagne again and LimaCharile should capture it.

## Step 4: Setup Slack and Tines and Test Connection between Tines and LimaCharlie 

* Set up an account on [Slack](https://slack.com/)

![sign up for slack](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15b4d34b-4c9f-496c-9871-6de75ecfe275)

* Create a channel for alerts. SOC Analysts tend to have a dedicated channel for alerts.
![create dedicated alerts channel in slack](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af12e7d3-0824-46ac-885c-259d2272b167)

* Set up an account on [Tines](https://www.tines.com/) and add a webhook. Copy the webhook url and go to LimaCharlie. Go to outputs and select Tines and paste the url.

![output tines limacharlie webhook](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/230f2da2-750d-47a1-b6fb-c7fd9bbf83d4)

* If everything works correctly, Tines should have the correct output alert.

## Step 5: Send a Message to Email and Slack and Generate a User Prompt

* Integrate Slack into Tines. Slack is compatible with Tines because Tines is a SOAR and SOARs tend to integrate with messaging apps like Slack easily.

![slack tines](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aaddb801-8a55-4825-ba73-c1fc4f4be1b2)

* Add the channel id to Tines in order to have the alert sent to the dedicated alert channel.

![slack alert channel id](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5ec94c8-9b0d-4573-83e5-b7bf155ce44e)

![slack alert channel id 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01e31be0-a24d-422c-a17d-73960bbc8599)

* Add the relevant fields to the message in order to get comprehensive alerts.

![Alert info](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59ffc85f-545a-4d70-b818-2c01e4e68f37)

- Time: Establishes when the event occurred, aiding in timeline reconstruction.
- Username: Identifies the account involved, indicating potential user-specific threats.
- Source IP: Locates the origin of the activity, which is crucial for identifying the attack's origin.
- Process: Details the specific process involved, helping in understanding the nature of the threat.
- Command Line: Reveals the exact commands executed, which can indicate malicious intent.
- File Path: Pinpoints the location of the executable, assisting in identifying unauthorized files.
- Sensor ID: Identifies the specific sensor that detected the threat, helping in tracing and validating the detection.
- Link to Detection: Provides direct access to detailed detection logs and reports for further analysis and response actions.

* These fields are the same for Slack, email, and User Prompt.


![slack alert tines test event info](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed1492a0-4991-4e9d-88a2-9185e0f2eac5)

![Tines email ](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed779dc1-a13e-44e1-8ffe-7553abd2084b)

![user prompt event info](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49fff851-a60f-442d-9388-067daa525c3b)

* For the User Prompt, make sure to include a Boolean since there is a true/false logic behind the triggers. If answered no, then the computer will not be isolated. If yes, then the computer will be isolated and LimaCharlie will assist with it.

![yes no trigger](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d623c945-fc9a-4112-bc63-a65b494fb303)

* Here is the alert on Slack when the computer is not isolated.

 ![slack not isolated message](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61211d8b-71d5-4648-a600-9a4711802ea5)

* Here is the alert on Slack when the computer is isolated.

  ![slack alert isolated ](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13c6ca99-5199-40b7-8027-e70619676a9b)

* In order to make sure LimaCharlie does isolate the computer, it has to be integrated into Tines. In order to do that, the API key for LimaCharlie is needed.

![limacharlie api](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36215846-fd4f-4ca6-8561-8765077e396c)

* When a computer is isolated, it is essentially cut off from the rest of the network to prevent the spread of any malicious activity or further compromise. Here are the typical outcomes and actions taken on an isolated computer:

1. Network Disconnection: The computer's network connectivity is severed, blocking both inbound and outbound communication. This means the computer can no longer communicate with other devices on the network or access the internet.
2. Containment: The isolation helps contain any potential threats, preventing malware or attackers from spreading to other systems within the network.
3. Investigation: The SOC team can safely investigate the isolated computer to identify the nature of the threat. This often involves forensic analysis, reviewing logs, and identifying malicious files or processes.
4. Remediation: The isolation provides an opportunity to remediate the issue without risking further network compromise. This may include removing malware, patching vulnerabilities, and ensuring no backdoors are left behind.
5. Monitoring: While isolated, the computer can still be monitored for any unusual activity or signs of compromise that might indicate additional remediation steps are necessary.
6.  Recovery: Once the threat is neutralized, and the computer is deemed safe, it can be reconnected to the network, ensuring it is fully patched and secure.

 Isolating a computer is a critical step in incident response to minimize damage and maintain the security of the broader network.
