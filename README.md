# SOAR-EDR-Project


## Objective

The SOAR EDR project focuses on creating a practical, automated security workflow using Lima Charlie, Tines, Slack, and email. The goal is to establish a streamlined process for detecting and responding to security threats. This involves setting up Lima Charlie to identify specific threats, such as a hack tool (Lazagne), and utilizing Tines to automate responses. Alerts with detailed information are sent to Slack and email, prompting a decision on whether to isolate a machine. If isolation is approved, it is automatically carried out.
The project integrates various security tools to enhance the efficiency of the detection and response process. By completion, participants will gain hands-on experience in setting up detection rules, creating automated playbooks, and managing security alertsâ€”key skills for any cybersecurity professional.



### Skills Learned
* **EDR Configuration and Management:** Skills in setting up and managing EDR systems, including the integration and customization of Lima Charlie for endpoint security.
* **SOAR Automation and Workflow Design:** Proficiency in using SOAR tools like Tines to automate security processes and create effective incident response workflows.
* **Security Integration and Communication:** Expertise in coordinating various security tools (e.g., Slack, email) for streamlined threat detection and response.
* **Playbook Development:** Ability to design and implement automated playbooks for efficient incident management and response.
* **Alert Management and Criteria Development:** Understanding of how to create and manage detailed security alerts, and developing criteria for automated machine isolation.
